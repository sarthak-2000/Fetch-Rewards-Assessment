# Fetch Rewards technical-assessment.

This project is a Spring Boot application that uses an H2 in-memory database. The application has been dockerized for easy deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Building and Running the Application

## Step1: Clone the Repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ````

## Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t api-application:latest .
```

## Step 3: Run the Docker Container
Run the following command to start your container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 api-application:latest
```

## Step 4: Access the Application and H2 Console
Once the container is running, you can access the following:

>Application: http://localhost:8080
>H2 Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console

For the H2 Console, use the following credentials:

>JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
>Username: sa
>Password: password

## Step 5: POST and GET requests for testing output.

```

curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/receipts/process' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{

    }
  ],
  "total": "35.35"
}'

# Assumptions for API Application

This document outlines the key assumptions made during the development of the API application using Spring Boot and H2 in-memory database.

---

## General Assumptions

1. **Stateless Application**:
   - The application does not persist data across restarts.
   - The H2 in-memory database is used, and all data is reset when the application restarts.

2. **In-Memory Database**:
   - H2 is used as an in-memory database for simplicity and development purposes.
   - Data is not stored permanently and will be lost when the application stops.

---

## Points Calculation Assumptions

The points calculation logic follows these rules and assumptions:

1. **Retailer Name**:
   - 1 point for each **alphanumeric character** in the retailer's name.
   - Non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., `&`, spaces) are not counted.

2. **Round Dollar Amount**:
   - 50 points are awarded if the total amount is a whole number (e.g., `9.00`).
   - A total of `9.00` is treated as a round dollar amount.

3. **Multiple of 0.25**:
   - 25 points are awarded if the total is divisible by `0.25` without a remainder.
   - Both round totals and decimal totals (e.g., `9.00`, `8.75`) are considered.

4. **Item Pairs**:
   - 5 points are awarded for every pair of items listed on the receipt.
   - E.g., 4 items result in 10 points (2 pairs Ã— 5 points).

5. **Item Description**:
   - If the trimmed length of an item description is a **multiple of 3**, multiply the item's price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer to determine points.
   - Each qualifying item description contributes individually to the total points.

6. **Purchase Date (Odd Day)**:
   - No points are awarded for even purchase dates.
   - 6 points are awarded only if the purchase date's day is odd.

7. **Purchase Time**:
   - 10 points are awarded if the purchase time falls between **2:00 PM and 4:00 PM**.
   - Times are inclusive, meaning `14:00` to `15:59` (24-hour format).

---

## Application Assumptions

1. **Request Validation**:
   - The application assumes that all incoming requests are well-formed.
   - No additional validation (e.g., missing fields, invalid types) is performed unless explicitly mentioned.

2. **Unique Receipt IDs**:
   - Each receipt is assigned a unique identifier (UUID).
   - The ID is returned upon processing and is used to fetch points.

3. **H2 Console**:
   - Enabled for development purposes at `/h2-console`.
   - Not recommended for production environments.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If a receipt ID is not found, a generic `Receipt not found` error is returned.

5. **Dockerization**:
   - The application assumes a single-container deployment, with no external dependencies beyond the container.

---

## Technical Assumptions

1. **Java Version**:
   - The application is developed and tested with **Java 17**.

2. **Port Configuration**:
   - The default application port is **8080**.
   - The H2 console is also accessible via port **8080**.

3. **Docker Usage**:
   - The Docker image assumes the application JAR is built as `apiApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

---

## Future Considerations

- For production, consider using a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) to retain data across restarts.
- Implement robust request validation and error handling for invalid inputs.
- Use environment variables to configure database credentials and application
